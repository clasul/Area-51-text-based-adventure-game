# Area-51-text-based-adventure-game
This is a small text-based adventure game I wrote for my final assignment in the Oxford Royale Computer Science course in 2019. 
It was based on the eponymous Area 51 raid, but written many weeks before the actual event took place.
Looking back, the raid definitely didn't end up as grim as I would've expected it to.

It is a very simple game, but was only meant to be a small project anyways.
